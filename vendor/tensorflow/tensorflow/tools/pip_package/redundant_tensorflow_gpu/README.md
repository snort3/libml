tensorflow-gpu has been removed. Please install tensorflow instead.
The tensorflow package supports GPU accelerated operations via Nvidia CUDA.

## Removal Information

tensorflow and tensorflow-gpu have been the same package since TensorFlow
2.1, released in September 2019. Although the checksums differ due to metadata,
they were built in the same way and both provide GPU support via Nvidia CUDA.
As of January 2023, tensorflow-gpu has been removed and has been replaced with
this new, empty package that generates an error upon installation.

All existing versions of tensorflow-gpu are still available, but the
TensorFlow team has stopped releasing any new tensorflow-gpu packages, and
will not release any patches for existing tensorflow-gpu versions.
