        You can collect some of this information using our [environment capture script](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tools/tf_env_collect.sh). You can also obtain the TensorFlow version with the following: <br> 1. TensorFlow 1.0: `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.GIT_VERSION, tf.VERSION)"` <br>2. TensorFlow 2.0: `python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.version.GIT_VERSION, tf.version.VERSION)"`
